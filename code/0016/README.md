Unsupervised K-Means clustering is one of the easiest ML algorithms to pick up, but using it requires some finesse.

Using the same Wholesale spend data from 0015, we get the percent of annual spend (assuming all 6 categories are total spend) and prepare a feature set for modeling. In the end, we can see that the Standard Scaler of percent annual spend does a good job differentiating the data among the other attributes.

Do you use K-means? How do you put it to use? What other algorithms do you implement? Do you use PyTorch of Tensorflow as well?
