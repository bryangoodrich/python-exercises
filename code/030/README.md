There are so many unsupervised (clustering) algorithms out there, it's a shame most data science programs I've seen only introduce you to K-Means and its variations. Let's look at how easy DBSCAN is!

With sklearn you can easily run it against a matrix of values. I put all the data together, so it's easy to plot. For this mock example, we can see where the data blends together and we get a mix of outliers and potential misclassifications. 

What other clustering algorithms do you use? Would you like to see hierarchical clustering? Let's talk in the chat!
