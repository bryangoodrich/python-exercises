Visualizing data distributions is an important part of exploratory data analysis (EDA). Luckily, #Python Seaborn makes this a breeze!

While this dataset is not excited it gets the point across. Wholesale orders for various product areas are cleaned up in the dataframe to then present the kernel density estimate (KDE). Often I'll do this against a histogram, but it would make this too cluttered. 

What other EDA things do you explore? How else might you have cleaned up this data? What are your chosen data viz for dispersion?
