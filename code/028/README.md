Before a good data analysis task, it will suit you to profile your data. Last week I showed how we can do something similar with the pandera library. However, it's also easy to build a dataframe to report on the table and column level attributes very easily with Pandas.

This snippet shows how easy we can define such a function and what the output looks like (truncated).
