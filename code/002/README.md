A common developer pattern is divide-and-conquer. This #python snippet shows how you can break a #dataengineering problem into bite-sized chunks.

By defining break points, you can use a list comprehension to break your data into batches for processing. Then process each batch using some function.

Do you want to see how generators can make this pattern more memory-efficient? You want to see a MapReduce pattern that exemplifies this? Let me know in the comments below!
