Let's up your autoregression game! What is it? Oh, basically modeling your dependent (y) variable with a lagged version of it. 

Now there are textbooks filled with how to go about the exploratory analysis to identify what AR terms are relevant (acf/pacf), but I wanted to show the comparison here between using an AR based model fit versus a lagged dependent OLS regression that does the same thing! I also add an extra covariate to show you can model an AR-X in either approach quite easily with #python

Have you had trouble with time series? What is your biggest hangup with them? Want to see the sort of EDA to better fit your ts models? Let me know in the comments!
