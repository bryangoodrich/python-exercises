Schema validation is significant, whether in #analytics or #dataengineering. Maybe you've heard about Pydantic, as its very common, but a recent training introduced me to Pandera. If you've ever done form validation in JavaScript using Formik and Yup, it has a very similar feel. 

You just define your schema object with check constraints (as functions or lambdas) then validate. This can easily be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline and automated integration testing.

What validation tools do you use in #python? Have you used Pandera? Are you running automated testing? Let me know in the comments below!
