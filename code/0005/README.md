You ever want to get into #statistics and #datascience using #python? If you're coming from, or familiar with, R, then you can use the statsmodels library's formula API in exactly the same syntax!

This snippet shows how we can take a basic dataset (one of Anscombe's quartet) to define and fit a model and review its summary statistics. Similarly, we could have fit "y ~ 1" to get the basic model to compare ANOVA statistics (also available in statsmodels). For that, see my GitHub ALSM project for more!

Are you new to statistics? Have you tried doing more complex modeling in statsmodels like time series or nested models? What other libraries do you use?
