# Topics

Previously I had a topics list I was doing for each day of the week I would cycle through. 

Instead, my topics will be random. This gives me more bandwidth to focused work, maybe spread over multiple days to refine a topic and its examples when it is more complex (e.g., package management). I can also then sprinkle basic topics for more novice developers throughout to cover days I have less time to develop for. 

With that said, my topics will cover many areas, including

- Data engineering pipelines
- Job orchestration
- Databases and data modeling
- Analytical methods
- Machine learning algorithms
- Feature engineering
- Data visualizations
- Game development
- Data structures
- and more ...
