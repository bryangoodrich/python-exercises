Let's do 100 Days of Python Together

Originally, this repo started off as my daily python tips and tricks, and I cycled through various topics. These ranged from statistics and analysis to functional programming vs OOP and game programming. Some topics were covering python basics and the standard library while others were quite advanced, like talking about Monads. 

The 100 days is complete, `data/` and `static/` have been moved to GitHub LFS for storage, and the `code/` folder contains all 100 days 001 - 100. All data references are to the data folder now, unless I messed something up. I may have gotten lazy and some images may not render correctly in a day's README.md file. I appreciate any issue reports that help me catch these issues!

### Future

The `pandas/` folder will contain the ongoing Daily Pandas series where I take very short bites of learning Pandas and its integrations with geopanas, matplotlib, statistics, and machine learning. 

I'm ramping up a Python Basics course where I'll cover the grassroots Python topics so you can understand how to become a Python developer from first principals, as a previous developer or not, and go at your own pace learning-by-doing. These will be shared on YouTube and social media (TBD).

My advanced topics will continue as personal projects I'll host on my old, and unused, substack at https://bryangoodrich.substack.com. Please join me there if you're interested in advanced projects where I'll work through fully engineered MLOps and data science solutions or data engineering solutions and services. These will also be all consolidated on my website when I finally get that developed to par. 

### Contact 

As always, I appreciate any feedback. Submit issues here or any pull requests if you want to contribute directly. I've no standards on this yet, but I'll appreciate any support. Hit me up on LinkedIn at bryangoodrich or Threads @bryangoodrich.xyz. My GitHub email is posted here, but it's basically a spam filter unless something significant does some through. Use at your own risk!
