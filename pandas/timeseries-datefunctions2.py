# üêç Daily Pandas üêº
#
# Continuing the time series theme, we can create ourselves a simple week of random data and look at different resampling methods to both downsample and upsample.
#
# Specifically, I first aggregate to every 2 hours by taking the mean of 0 and 1, 2 and 3, and so on. You could do the max or sum or even custom aggregates at this point.
#
# With upsampling, I can request a frequency like every 15-minutes and while the gaps off-hour will be NaNs, we can choose a number of ways to fill those gaps, such as fillna, forward fill, backfill, use the nearest value, or interpolate.
#
# It is really impressive how easy it is to do this. I'll continue exploring these time series features built into Pandas tomorrow!
