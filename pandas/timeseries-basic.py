# One thing I really like about Pandas is the built-in time series operations it has. One of those is the diff method you can take on a DataFrame or Series object. Here I pull out the first difference (lag1) and the difference of the difference (lag2). I also pass in 12 to get the difference between each point and 12 points ago, in case there's some 12 hour seasonality in the data. Really, AR would have been a correlation, but this is my stand-in.
