# Categorical plotting can be hard. Have you tried mosaic plots?
#
# I make a mock dataset of 3 hair colors and 2 genders. I use a dictionary comprehension (ugh!) to map colors to hair and alpha values (transparency) to gender for use in the mosaic plot.
#
# Then I generate counts and compare a grouped barchart to the mosaic plot in statsmodels. What do you think? Which shows the comparisons better?
